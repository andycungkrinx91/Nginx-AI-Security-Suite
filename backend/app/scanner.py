    As a cybersecurity expert, you are reviewing the security headers for the website: `{target_url}`.

    The following critical security headers are missing: **{', '.join(missing_headers)}**.

    Please provide a concise, actionable report in Markdown format. The report MUST have the following three sections:
    **Security Headers Summary:**

    ## 1. Overall Security Grade
    Assign a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the number and importance of the missing headers and briefly explain your reasoning.

    ## 2. Impact of Missing Headers
    Briefly explain the security risk associated with each of the missing headers. Use bullet points for clarity.

    ## 3. Nginx Remediation Guide
    Provide a single, ready-to-use Nginx configuration code block with the correct `add_header` directives to fix all the missing headers.

    ## 4. Apache Remediation Guide
    Provide a single, ready-to-use Apache configuration code block with the correct `add_header` directives to fix all the missing headers. Or using .htaccess if applicable.
